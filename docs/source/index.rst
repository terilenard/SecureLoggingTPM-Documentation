Secure Logging with a Trusted Platform Module documentation
===========================================================

The current page serves as the official documentation developed by the `Information Security Lab <https://isec.unige.ch/>`_ (I-SEC) at University of Geneva as part of the `Optimization of Electric Vehicle Autonomy (OPEVA) project <https://opeva.eu/>`_. This documentation shows how to setup a virtual environment with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) that is used by a Secure Logging Service.

How to follow the documentation
-------------------------------
We recommend to follow the current documentation from start to finish, as it goes step by step from dependencies installation, environment and services configuration, and setting up the Secure Logging Service.
